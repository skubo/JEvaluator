http://jeval.sourceforge.net
----------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

JEval is the advanced library for adding mathematical, string, Boolean and 
functional expression parsing and evaluation to your Java applications. 

JEval Features:

* Parses and evaluates dynamic and static expressions at run time.
* A great solution for filtering data at runtime.
* Supports mathematical, Boolean, String and functional expressions.
* Supports all major mathematical and Boolean operators.
* Supports custom functions.
* 39 Math and String functions built in and ready to use.
* Supports nested functions.
* Supports variables.
* Allows for custom variable resolver.
* No reparsing of expressions when variables change.
* No dependencies to other non-standard Java libraries.
* JUnit tests.
* Compatible with J2SE 1.2 and above.

2. RELEASE INFO

JEval requires J2SE 1.2 and above.  This release was tested using J2SE 1.5.0_13 
running in Java 1.3 compatibility mode.

Release contents:
* "src" contains the Java source files for the project
